## react-brunch
Adds [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) support to [brunch](http://brunch.io)
by automatically compiling `*.jsx` files.

### Optional

Example `config.coffee`:

```coffeescript
exports.config =
  plugins:
    react:
      transformOptions:
        # options passed through to `react-tools.main.transformWithDetails()`
        harmony: yes    # include some es6 transforms
        sourceMap: no   # generate inline source maps
        stripTypes: no  # strip type annotations
      # if you use babel to transform jsx, transformOptions would be passed though to `babel.transform()`
      # See: http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/
      babel: false
  # Usual brunch config stuf...
  files:
    javascripts:
      joinTo: 'app.js'
    stylesheets:
      joinTo: 'app.css'
    templates:
      joinTo: 'app.js'
```

### Notes

react-brunch only supports compiling `*.jsx` files. It doesn't peek at `*.js` to
see if they have the React-ify comment header. I doubt it ever will. Here's why:

Any `.js` file should be browser loadable. Embedding JSX will break in any JS
environment. Therefore, I chose to have react-brunch only pre-processes `.jsx`
files.


## Usage
Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save react-brunch`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"react-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
  Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"react-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/react-brunch.git"`.
